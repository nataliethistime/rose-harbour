# Rose Harbour

New personal website project for myself using Astro!

üíê Check her out here https://nataliethistime.com/

So far, the site has been based off of Astro's blog template, which uses styles from the lovely
[Bear Blog](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog/). You can start your own using the following command (requires
node and npm):

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```
