Occasionally, I stay up all night just for fun. I enjoy the quiet and the feeling that I'm experiencing something that
nobody else is. In this case however, it was accidental. Late in the evening, I'd gotten a decaf coffee from a local
cafe and it turned out to not be decaf! After lying in bed for an hour I gave up on the idea of sleeping and hit the
road. I chose Bribie cause I'd never been before.. and it was beautiful. Back to Brisbane via Mt Mee was gorgeous too.
