Driving to Melbourne for Web Directions Code 2024! This was my first time driving the Newell Hwy myself after an entire
childhood of traveling the road for family events multiple times a year. It was really fun recognising landmarks from
the past and putting it all together in a new way! Throughout the drive I felt like my energy levels were increasing
rather than decreasing. I was glad to arrive and stop for the night but could have continued, for forever perhaps.
