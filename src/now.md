# Now

## August 2025

Extended very bad mental health time. Kept myself distracted by finishing
[The West Wing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276) and revisiting some films I haven't seen since they came out such
as [The Batman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830) and [Oppenheimer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776).

ðŸŽ¶ [Straight Line Was A Lie](https://open.spotify.com/album/5XbVk30ifqaiI6EiVVjA1p) by The Beths

## July 2025

Been tinkering with some music ideas and playing with building a homelab setup for backups.

Due to an adhd med change gone awry, I've otherwise not done much outside of work and sleep.

## June 2025

Still finding my feet after a very chaotic start to the year. Moved into my own apartment three months ago and have just
attended [Web Directions Code](https://webdirections.org/code/) + [Leaders](https://webdirections.org/leaders/).
Spending my time lately thinking about JS build tools, web fundamentals and Formula 1 (go Oscar Piastri!)

ðŸ“º I've been absolutely obsessed with [Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/)

ðŸŽ¶ [Fantasy](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/m83/fantasy/) by M83 and the debut self-titled
[Illo.Trio](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/illo_trio/illo_trio/) album have been playing on repeat

ðŸŽ¥ Check out [The Wild Robot](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wild-robot/), gorgeous film highly recommend
