# Now

## September 2025

Still really struggling with mental health but starting to round the curve a little. Painted my garage and saw friends
more which was lovely. Spent a bunch of time learning [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) and working on my Homelab (publishing
docker images on a private [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) package registry and setting up some new infra).

Ordinarily, when having a really rough time, I stop really listening to music. I think once I'm in that space I start
feeling like nothing is good or fun and it just doesn't resonate. This month was a huge contrast to that though wherein
I spent a lot of time listening to three whole albums that were new to me.

I also had friends over at my place a few times to watch movies as well as getting to the cinema to catch The Long Walk.

ðŸŽ¥ Three favourite films this month: [Death Becomes Her](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104070),
[Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6710474), and
[The Long Walk](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10374610)

Overall I've found this year very tough.. and the end isn't in sight yet.

But it's getting better.

Slowly.

## August 2025

Extended very bad mental health time. Kept myself distracted by finishing
[The West Wing](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276) and revisiting some films I haven't seen since they came out such
as [The Batman](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830) and [Oppenheimer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15398776).

## July 2025

Been tinkering with some music ideas and playing with building a homelab setup for backups.

Due to an adhd med change gone awry, I've otherwise not done much outside of work and sleep.

## June 2025

Still finding my feet after a very chaotic start to the year. Moved into my own apartment three months ago and have just
attended [Web Directions Code](https://webdirections.org/code/) + [Leaders](https://webdirections.org/leaders/).
Spending my time lately thinking about JS build tools, web fundamentals and Formula 1 (go Oscar Piastri!)

ðŸ“º I've been absolutely obsessed with [Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/)

ðŸŽ¶ [Fantasy](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/m83/fantasy/) by M83 and the debut self-titled
[Illo.Trio](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/illo_trio/illo_trio/) album have been playing on repeat
