# CSS Reset

This site uses a CSS reset I really like which was created by [Elly Loel](https://ellyloel.com/)

Her original code can be found at [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/EllyLoel/4ff8a6472247e6dd2315fd4038926522)
and the way I've implemented it is viewable in the [website source code](<%= meta.siteRepository
%>/blob/main/src/\_includes/styles/reset.css).
