# Now

## June 2025

Still finding my feet after a very chaotic start to the year. Moved into my own apartment three months ago and have just
attended [Web Directions Code](https://webdirections.org/code/) + [Leaders](https://webdirections.org/leaders/).
Spending my time lately thinking about JS build tools, web fundamentals and Formula 1 (go Oscar Piastri!)

ðŸ“º I've been absolutely obsessed with [Severance](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11280740/)

ðŸŽ¶ [Fantasy](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/m83/fantasy/) by M83 and the debut self-titled
[Illo.Trio](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/illo_trio/illo_trio/) album have been playing on repeat

ðŸŽ¥ Check out [The Wild Robot](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-wild-robot/), gorgeous film highly recommend
