# Interesting Laws

A collection of laws and/or observations that I think are fun. A lot of these have been collected while scrolling Hacker
News or other social media sites. There's something about building up a personal collection of mental models that I find
to be satisfying! ðŸ˜…

- **Arthur C. Clarke**: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
- **Doctorow's Law**: Anytime someone puts a lock on something you own, against your wishes, and doesn't give you the
  key, they're not doing it for your benefit.
- **Gall's Law**: A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
- **Hanlon's Razor**: Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.
- **Miller's Law, in communication**: To understand what another person is saying, you must assume that it is true and
  try to imagine what it could be true of.
- **Parkinson's Law**: Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.
- **Papert's Principle**: "Some of the most crucial steps in mental growth are based not simply on acquiring new skills,
  but on acquiring new administrative ways to use what one already knows."
- **Peter Principle**: People in hierarchies will rise to the point of incompetence.
- **Sagan Standard**: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
- **Schneier's Law**: Any person can invent a security system so clever that she or he can't think of how to break it.
- **The Law of the Instrument**: When all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

If you're interested in collecting more of these for yourself, definitely check out the Wikipedia page
