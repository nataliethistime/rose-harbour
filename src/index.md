Queer woman with a spicy brain. Web developer, fast car enjoyer and occasional musician. Interested in making the web a

I am currently working on a global commercial people logistics solution as a Senior Developer. I also devote my spare

<a href='https://tlecommunity.com' target='_blank'>TLE Community</a>.

I'm available for consulting work with <%= new Date().getFullYear() - 2018 %>+ years of experience in:
JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, Perl, PHP, MySQL/MongoDB, React/Vue, and various CSS frameworks.
