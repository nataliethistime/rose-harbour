# CSS Reset

This site uses a CSS reset I really like which was created by [Elly Loel](https://ellyloel.com/)

Her original code can be found at [this GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/EllyLoel/4ff8a6472247e6dd2315fd4038926522)
and the way I've implemented it is viewable in the
[website source code](https://github.com/nataliethistime/rose-harbour/blob/main/src/styles/reset.css).
