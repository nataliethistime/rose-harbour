One of my favourite drives ever. I took a wrong turn and ended up driving to Esk by going the other way around the dam
and it was gorgeous. By coincidence, this drive contains the moment that Claire became the car I've driven the furthest.
The scenery and sunset felt very appropriate for the occasion :3
