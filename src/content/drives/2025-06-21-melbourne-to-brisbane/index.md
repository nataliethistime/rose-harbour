Did one of those cheap hire car relocation deals (companies need cars moved around for various reasons and so they offer
deals instead of paying for the car to be driven/transported). The car was bad, so the act of dragging it home against
its will was quite satisfying. And I enjoyed being out on the road. But overall I just wanted to be driving my Mercedes
instead.
