Heading home after a Sydney trip with parents. I was exhausted from working 14 hours the previous day and so rushed
through the preparation for the drive. I decided to take the inland route through Tamworth however it ended up being a
terrible time. It rained almost the whole day and there were a few car issues that I was distracted by and mentally I
struggled to maintain focus/presence. I was feeling desperate for it to be over, the whole time. My worst executed drive
by a long shot.
