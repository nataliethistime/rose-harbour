Finally back with Claire and heading home from Melbourne for real. There was an accident on the highway on the north
side of Melbourne. Traffic was crawling and I almost ran out of fuel because of a missed turn. After refueling, the
traffic took an eternity to subside. It was truly miserable. Managed to get some nice photos though!
